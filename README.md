## About The Project

This Weather Forecast App uses the One Call API and Geocoding API from [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/api). This fully responsive site gives the current 
weather forecast for any location, using the current local time in the chosen destination, as well as giving a 48 hour and 7 day forecast.

## Live version [here](https://amy-weather.netlify.app/).

## Current Issues
* The search bar currently only supports the complete name of a city/town/village name or this name followed by the country code. There is no preview for destinations, to, for example, 
differentiate between York County, US or York, GB. A search for "York" will produce "York County, US", whereas a search for "York, GB" will produce "York, GB". Sometimes the country 
code is necessary to select the correct destination.
